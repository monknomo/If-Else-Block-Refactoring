# If-Else-Block-Refactoring
Refactoring business logic with nested if/else code blocks

This repository accompanies a series of blog posts on how to refactor business logic.  It is intended as a readability aid to my blog posts about refactoring.

[The first blog post covers starting with deeply nested if/else blocks and spaghetti code business logic.](https://www.gunnargissel.com/turn-your-spaghetti-code-into-functions-part-1.html)

[The second blog post brings Java 8 functional style programming into the mix](https://www.gunnargissel.com/turn-your-spaghetti-code-into-functions-part-2.html)

[The third blog post dives into the functional style of code, and uses a validator that takes functions to evaluate data](https://www.gunnargissel.com/turn-your-spaghetti-code-into-functions-part-3.html)
